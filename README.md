# weather-application

This application will display the current weather and 5-day forecast of any city. 

The motivation behind this project was to use the Open Weather API to create a functional weather application so the user can seee current weather and the 5-day forecast. Through building this application, I learned how to use fetch to get weather data from the Open weather API. 

To get this application up and running, follow the deployed Github page below: 

[Deployed Application](https://mcquo011.github.io/weather-application/)

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Open weather API

## Installation 

Used git clone to connect my repo to my local device.

## Usage

To use this weather application, simply search for a city using the search bar on the main screen. When the search button is clicked, the current weather will be displayed showing the date, temperature, humidity, and wind-speed. The next five days of weather will display below the current weather. The user will also see icons indicating the current weather conditions. Below the search bar users will see their city search history. If the user clicks on a previous city, that city weather will display. The user can clear the search histy with the "Clear history" button.
